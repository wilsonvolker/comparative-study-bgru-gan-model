# Personal notes

1. Do we need to include feature importance? Seems not
2. PCA might not be working when training GAN model. Consider make one more version of dataset that does not apply the PCA.

# Few problems:
1. BGRU hyper param: 100 epochs, 10 early stop patient, dropout 0.3 & 0.5 cause underfitting
